# Project Proposal: Bottoms Up
Write a proposal for a software product you would like to pursue for the majority of the semester.   Make it obvious, interesting, and make the need for it sound convincing.

## Current Team
Charles Condon, Maneesh Karnati, Diego Mendoza, Dhruv Shetty

### What and why?
The issue we are trying to solve is the lack of a centralized database of cocktail ideas and instructions that are personalized to fit what’s in your home. This is a challenge that we all have experienced personally and wish to remedy it in a software oriented solution.

### For whom?
This software is for anyone over the age of 21. This web application is perfect for a range of demographics that want to experiment and indulge in the vast array of alcoholic beverages. Additionally, it may be appealing to inexperienced drinkers who don’t know many recipes outside of mainstream drinks or those who want to expand their knowledge base.

### How?
Each user will be able to create a personal account after which they will be able to enter in a list of all their available drink related ingredients (i.e. what they have on hand). The program will then analyze what is available and return a list of drink recipes that the user can make with what they have. Possible additional features include being able to search up drink recipes based on alcohol or specific ingredients. Nutrition facts about beverages, such as alcohol and sugar content, can be returned to the user as well. Lastly, we hope to experiment in making a social aspect of this web application so that users can communicate with friends and family.

### Scope
With 4 - 5 programmers to undertake in one semester, the main focus points of the project would be to connect the recipe API to both a central database as well as the front end website and also gain a firm understanding of how each piece works.
